Extension to [`ruix/workflowy`](https://github.com/ruxi/workflowy) and [`opusfluxus`](https://github.com/malcolmocean/opusfluxus) with the possibility to define aliases for nodes ‚Üí easier access without remembering IDs üòÑ

Used in my [`Workflowy Telegram bot`](https://github.com/lacinoire/workflowy-tg-bot).

# opusfluxus

NodeJS wrapper for WorkFlowy. Created for integration with [Complice](https://complice.co), a productivity app that's less "what are all the parts of this thing I have to do?" and more ***"what am I going to do today?"***

This is super early stage! Currently the main advantages it has over [the original](https://github.com/ruxi/workflowy) are:

- it has a primitive command-line interface
- it supports creating new nodes, which allows you to easily capture items to your workflowy :D
- it supports auth by sessionid cookie, meaning you don't need to store the user's password in plaintext anywhere. highly recommended *(EDIT: it seems the original might allow this using some sort of "cookie jar", but I don't know how that's supposed to work.)*

Also this project is in JavaScript, so if you prefer that to working in CoffeeScript, you've come to the right place.

## Install to your node project

```bash
npm install --save opusfluxus
```

## Install as a command-line tool

```bash
sudo npm install --global opusfluxus

wf # run this once to ensure you're authenticated
```

### Usage as a command-line tool

Currently only has two features. One is to print your list (`wf tree 1` prints just top-level nodes, `wf tree 2` prints those and their children, etc) and the other is to append datapoints to a given node:

#### Print tree

Thanks to [sujunmin](https://github.com/sujunmin) this now has a bunch of options:

```bash
tree [n]             print your workflowy nodes up to depth n (default: 2)
  --id=<id>            print sub nodes under the <id> (default: whole tree)
  --withnote           print the note of nodes (default: false)
  --hiddencompleted    hide the completed lists (default: false)
  --withid             print id of nodes (default: false)
```

#### Capture/append

Use Workflowy for tasks but wish you had a quicker way to capture things to your inbox? Now you can do that! Well, it takes a little set-up, but once you've got it it's awesome.

The command is `capture`, and here's the spec:

```bash
capture            add something to a particular node
   --parentid=<id>      <36-digit uuid of parent> (required)
   --name=<str>         what to actually put on the node
  [--priority=#]        0 as first child, 1 as second (default 0 (top))
                            (use a number like 10000 for bottom)
  [--note=<str>]        a note for the node (default '')

```

`wf capture --parentid "<36-digit uuid>" --priority=0 --name ""`

How to get the parentid:

- go to Workflowy
- right-click on the circle to the left of the node you want to add children to
- click Inspect
- then you'll see an element called `<div class="project" projectid="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000">`
- that 36-digit id is the parentid you want.

Priority = 0 (which is default) inserts the item at the top. You can use a very big number to force it to submit at the bottom instead.

I have the following in `.bash_aliases`, which allows me to instantly capture any todo to a node appropriately called **inbox**.

```bash
alias win="wf capture --parentid='00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000' --name"
```

So then I just open terminal and type `win "1) call Benjamin #thursday"

Oh, and by the way, that task then gets automatically pulled onto thursday's todo list, thanks to [Complice](https://complice.co/and/workflowy).
